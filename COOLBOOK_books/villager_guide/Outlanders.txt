Outlanders have always been a debated topic amongst our people, but one much truly know the histories to remember the truth.
Fear not the outlander with open arms, know the fear they may bring within.  Teach them to remember peace.  Teach them
to know that the swamp, and we, are not their enemies.

If after the words are spoken then they retain their will to spill blood, then know the spirits understand what must be done.

While this section is small, there are some notes about the nearby groups.

--PAGEBREAK--

- Mankara: When the winterhell came and our people died we ran to the village of Mankara.  Remember that in a time of horror
they flung open their gates, they clothed our people, and they allowed us space to live our way. They are sometimes brash,
bold, soaked in bravado, and overbearing but they let us in.  There is a debt owed for that. A debt that can only be
repaid in kindness, lest we anger the spirits.

- Redwater: Gone is this hellpit.  Gone are the slavers, the defilers, and the wicked. It did not take much proding from 
our hunters spears to coerce the madmen to form an alliance with the Great Defiler. Redwater burned for its sins, even while
our people ran through the swamps and bled to try and stop the monsters from the south.  There remains a few of their kind
still in this land, let them rest.  Perhaps they will learn from the mistakes of their past.

- Ashdown: The town on the mountain, hidden to many until recently, seems like a refuge to those who wish to escape the madness
of the swamplands.  Though at times their people are scarce, they do seem to be good spirited generally. Treat them kindly, but
the Nomads they took in with some waryness. They came from another place, perhaps even another time, and their ways are... odd.

- Wastelanders: Those who wander are like a leaf with a blighted and healthy side. Some, like that blight, destroy. They are to
be avoided if possible, let their anger and rage eat them alive in the swamps until the geckos gnaw the marrow from their bones.
Those who are healthy in their ways should be encouraged. Assisted.  Like a druid tending to the broc, help them to grow.

Smaller Groups

- The Renegades: We don't know where these men came from, with their guns.  They have camps about the land, and raiding parties.
Steer clear of their kind, and know that they seem to seek nothing but death, destruction, defiling and bloodshed.  Our warriors
skirmished with them for a time, but now we are largely able to ignore them.

- Fruit Gang: Madmen.  All of them.  Mango Mathew and his madmen are a blight.  They may have oblitered Redwater,
but that doesn't clear their souls from what came after.
