Treat this chapter as an OOC Guide for doing things such as strip teases, and poledancing!

The first thing that we ask of you is to possibly consider doing some research on the topic.  Learn what it actually takes to do this kind of work in the real world, or don't and just let your imagination run rampant.

Some tips though!

Use your hotkeys!
- There are a multitude of hotkeys that are available for you to set verbs to, go to OOC -> Game Preferences -> Keybinding and explore the list of verbs available.  Play with what keys you may wish to assign them to!  
It can make your performance much, much, more visually eyecatching if you can use these in a ready and controlled manner. Some really common verbs will be listed below, you can enter them manually into says as well by putting an
asterisk at the start!  

jump
bwoing
spin
flip

There are certainly more, and you can find the entire insane list with the *help command.  There is a WIP concept that is being setup to make using these a bit less tedious, but for now know that you have them available and
that they are your friend. Experiment with them!  Work out a routine, be the flexible creature that draws attention!

Also, realize that this may be a job that you do to lead into another, perhaps consider browsing the chapter labeled Roses in the Garden?
