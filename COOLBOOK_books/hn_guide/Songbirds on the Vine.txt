This chapter is an OOC guide to making the most out of your instrument.

Some things to really consider.
- Turn your instruments volume down, SS13 instruments are notorious for sounding pretty awful, but you can minimize the pain by lowering the volume. More.  Turn it down to like 10~.
- Realize that some instruments really just do sound way better than others, the king of finding the right sound is the synthesizer though. As it can play any instruments sounds.

Tools & Tips
There exists a tool that you can, and should, consider using.  It comes with our code, but you can google search it with 'ss13 midi2piano.' It's github can also be found at-

https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/master/tools/midi2piano/midi2piano.py

Now, it does require you isntall python but that's fairly simple.  Essentially what the tool does is open a prompt to open a midi file with, and when you select one you it will format it into
the ss13 music sheet format to the best of its ability and copy it to your clipboard so all you have to do is paste it!  Even includes the BPM!

So, the question then is WHERE do you find midis?

Well, your best bet is going to be a google search, I (fenny) generally use https://www.hamienet.com/ but I'll be real with you, its old and it skeezes even me out a bit. 

What you should do, if you can find a website to give you midis, is focus on getting smaller parts of songs.  Just the acoustic track, or just the lead guitar. SS13s music system often gets very garbled if it 
is forced to try and play too many 'channels' essentially at once.  Better to give up range for clarity in my oppinion.



- What if there are two people playing?  Or more?

There's not much that can be done here.  IF, BY CHANCE, all of you are using synthesizers then you can select electric guitar and keep playing your own music.  This will grant the musician benefits but put out no noise.
It's a bug, but its one you can freely use.

If not, then your best bet is to just pretend.  I know, the horror. What does this look like, Starbound?
